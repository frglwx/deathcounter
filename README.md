<h1>Yet Another Souls-like Death Counter (Python)</h1>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<li>tkinter (For Window)</li>
<li>pynput (For keyboard listening)</li>
<li>threading (For running application in the background)</li>

This is just a little death counter I wrote to track my failure. There are some little issues and graphical things I will be adding.

<h2>TODO</h2>
<li>Fix F10 not resetting (only seems to do it after two presses for some reason)</li>
<li>Make pretty visuals</li>
<li>Add a way to save progress \ snapshot and save deaths and label for what boss</li>
