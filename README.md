* Yet Another Souls-like Death Counter (Python)
- Libraries:
-- tkinter (For Window)
-- pynput (For keyboard listening)
-- threading (For running application in the background)


This is just a little death counter I wrote to track my failure. There are some little issues and graphical things I will be adding.

- TODO:
-- Fix F10 not resetting (only seems to do it after two presses for some reason)
-- Make pretty visuals
-- Add a way to save progress \ snapshot and save deaths and label for what boss
